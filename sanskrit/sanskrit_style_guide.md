# Sanskrit column style guide

### General guidelines
- use comma "," for separating synonyms
- use backslash "/" for separating lexical or grammatical variants
- do not use "or"
- use brackets and less than sign "(< xyz) to denote the headword of an inflected form
- use round brackets "(...)" in call cases, square brackets "[...]" are reserved for code-based additions
- use sūkta / sūtra for all discourses 
- in all cases try and show a word form contained in Monier Williams, Edgerton or Apte

### Compounds
- preferably show the full compound and the word breakup in brackets
- e.g. ākrośabhāradvāja (ākrośa + bhāradvāja)

### Inflected forms
- show the inflected form and then the lemma in brackets with a less than sign
- e.g. akṛtataḥ / akṛtāt (< akṛta)

### Words derived from roots
- show the derived verbal form, the lemma will be added programmatically in square brackets
- e.g. prakīrya [parikṝ]

### Negative forms
- show the negative form and the breakup in brackets
- e.g. agatvā (na + gatvā)

### Taddhita forms
- show the full word and, if the word is not in the Sanskrit dicitonaries, show the breakup in brackets
- e.g. buddhatā (buddha + -tā)
- e.g. madhuratā
