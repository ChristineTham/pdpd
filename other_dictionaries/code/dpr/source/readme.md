This JSON file was originally found in the Tipitaka Pali Projector repository. It seems to be an attempt to run each word in the CST through DPR Analysis and produce a flat lookup file. The results seem slightly different to the actual DPR Analysis which produces multiple solutions. Still, it is useful as a reference.
