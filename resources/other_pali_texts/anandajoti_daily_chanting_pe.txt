In a similar way to oneself, all beings desire happiness,

Karaṇīyamettasuttaṁ





The Discourse on how Friendliness Meditation should be Done


Karaṇīyam-atthakusalena, yan-taṁ santaṁ padaṁ abhisamecca:

What should be done by one skilled in goodness, who has comprehended the state of peace:

sakko ujū ca sūjū ca, suvaco cassa mudu anatimānī, [1]

he ought to be able, straight, and upright, easy to speak to, meek, without conceit,

santussako ca subharo ca, appakicco ca sallahukavutti,

satisfied (with little), easy to support, free from duties, and light in living,

santindriyo ca nipako ca, appagabbho kulesu ananugiddho, [2]

with faculties at peace, prudent, not forward, and greedless among the families,

na ca khuddaṁ samācare kiñci yena viññū pare upavadeyyuṁ.

he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault (with him).

“Sukhino vā khemino hontu, sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā! [3]

“(May all beings) be happy and secure, may all beings in their hearts be happy!

Ye keci pāṇabhūtatthi tasā vā thāvarā vā anavasesā,

Whatsoever breathing beings there are, trembling, firm, or any other (beings),

dīghā vā ye mahantā vā, majjhimā rassakāṇukathūlā, [4]

whether they be long or great, of middle (size), short, tiny, or of compact (body),

diṭṭhā vā ye ca addiṭṭhā, ye ca dūre vasanti avidūre,

those who are seen, and those who are unseen, those who live far away, those who are near,

bhūtā vā sambhavesī vā sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā!” [5]

those who are born, and those who still seek birth, may all beings in their hearts be happy!”

Na paro paraṁ nikubbetha, nātimaññetha katthaci naṁ kañci,

No one should cheat another, nor should he despise anyone wherever he is,

byārosanā paṭighasaññā nāññam-aññassa dukkham-iccheyya. [6]

he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment.

Mātā yathā niyaṁ puttaṁ āyusā ekaputtam-anurakkhe,

In the same way as a mother would protect her child, her only child, with her life,

evam-pi sabbabhūtesu mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ. [7]

so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought (of friendliness).

Mettañ-ca sabbalokasmiṁ mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ,

Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness,

uddhaṁ adho ca tiriyañ-ca, asambādhaṁ averaṁ asapattaṁ. [8]

above, below, and across (the middle), without barriers, hate, or enmity.

Tiṭṭhaṁ caraṁ nisinno vā, sayāno vā yāvatassa vigatamiddho,

Standing, walking, sitting, lying, for as long as he is without torpor,

etaṁ satiṁ adhiṭṭheyya, brahmam-etaṁ vihāraṁ idha-m-āhu. [9]

he should be resolved on this mindfulness, for this, they say here, is the (true) spiritual life.

Diṭṭhiñ-ca anupagamma, sīlavā dassanena sampanno,

Without going near a (wrong) view, virtuous, and endowed with (true) insight,

kāmesu vineyya gedhaṁ, na hi jātu gabbhaseyyaṁ punar-etī ti. [10]

having removed greed towards sense pleasures, he does not come to lie in a womb again.

Just as people who have attained great good fortune here have died,

tathā ahaṁ marissāmi maraṇaṁ mama hessati. [2]

in the same way will I die death is (surely) coming to me.

Uppattiyā sahevedaṁ maraṇaṁ āgataṁ sadā,

Indeed death always comes along with that which has arisen,

maraṇatthāya okāsaṁ vadhako viya esati. [3]

it is like a murderer who is seeking an opportunity to kill.

Īsakaṁ anivattaṁ taṁ satataṁ gamanussukaṁ,

° This life is slowly, without turning back, continually, eagerly,

jīvitaṁ udayā atthaṁ suriyo viya dhāvati. [4]

going its way, it rises and falls just as the sun runs its course (and sets).

Vijjububbula-ussāva, jalarājī parikkhayaṁ,

(Like) lightning, a bubble, dew, a line drawn on water, life (quickly goes to) destruction,

ghātako varipūtassa sabbatthā pi avāriyo. [5]

like an executioner in regard to his rival (death) can never be constrained.

Suyasatthāmapuññiddhī buddhivuddhī Jinadvayaṁ,

Even the two kinds of Victors, who are famous, strong, meritorious, powerful, and of great intelligence,

ghātesi maraṇaṁ khippaṁ, kā tu mādisake kathā? [6]

were quickly slaughtered by death, so what to say about one like me?

Paccayānañ-ca vekalyā bāhirajjhattupaddavā,

When conditions fail there are internal and external adversities,

marāmoraṁ nimesā pi maramāno anukkhaṇan-ti. [7]

dying at each and every moment I will die in less (time) than a blink of an eye.

Jātijarāvyādhicutī apāyā, atīta-appattakavaṭṭadukkhaṁ,

Birth, old age, sickness, death, the lower realms, the past and future suffering in the round,

idāni āhāragaveṭṭhidukkhaṁ saṁvegavatthūni imāni aṭṭha. [2]

the suffering in having to seek food in the present, these are the eight bases for urgency.

Pāto ca sāyam-api ceva imaṁ vidhiñño,

If, in the morning and in the evening, one who knows the way,

āsevate satatam-attahitābhilāsi,

who desires his own benefit, practises (these meditations) continually,

pappoti so ti vipulaṁ hatapāripantho,

° then after destroying (even) extensive obstacles, that sage

seṭṭhaṁ sukhaṁ muni visiṭṭhamataṁ sukhena cā ti. [3]

easily attains great happiness, and the distinction of the deathless.





Mettānisaṁsasuttaṁ





The Discourse on the Advantages of Friendliness Meditation


Evaṁ me sutaṁ:

Thus I have heard:

ekaṁ samayaṁ Bhagavā Sāvatthiyaṁ viharati

at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī

Jetavane Anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.

at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.

Tatra kho Bhagavā bhikkhū āmantesi:

There it was that the Fortunate One addressed the monks, saying:

“Bhikkhavo!” ti, “Bhadante!” ti te bhikkhū Bhagavato paccassosuṁ,

“Monks!”, “Reverend Sir!” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,

Bhagavā etad-avoca:

and the Fortunate One said this:

“Mettāya bhikkhave cetovimuttiyā,

“Monks, from the freedom of mind by friendliness meditation,

āsevitāya, bhāvitāya, bahulīkatāya,

when practised, developed, made much of,

yānīkatāya, vatthukatāya, anuṭṭhitāya, paricitāya, susamāraddhāya,

carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated,

ekādasānisaṁsā pāṭikaṅkhā. Katame ekādasa?

eleven advantages are to be expected. What are the eleven?

Sukhaṁ supati, sukhaṁ paṭibujjhati, na pāpakaṁ supinaṁ passati,

He sleeps happily, he wakes up happily, he does not see bad dreams,

Manussānaṁ piyo hoti, amanussānaṁ piyo hoti,

He is dear to human beings, he is dear to non-human beings,

Devatā rakkhanti, nāssa aggi vā visaṁ vā satthaṁ vā kamati,

The gods protect him, neither fire, poison, or sword can affect him,

Tuvataṁ cittaṁ samādhiyati, mukhavaṇṇo vippasīdati,

He can concentrate his mind quickly, his complexion becomes clear,

asammūḷho kālaṁ karoti,

he dies unbewildered,

uttariṁ appaṭivijjhanto Brahmalokūpago hoti.

and if he penetrates no further, he will (at least) go to the Brahma world.

Mettāya bhikkhave cetovimuttiyā,

Monks, from the freedom of mind by friendliness meditation,

āsevitāya, bhāvitāya, bahulīkatāya,

when practised, developed, made much of,

yānīkatāya, vatthukatāya, anuṭṭhitāya, paricitāya, susamāraddhāya,

carried on, established, maintained, augmented, and properly instigated,

there are these eleven advantages to be expected.”

Idam-avoca Bhagavā,

The Fortunate One said this,

What is the reason for that?

Idam-avoca Bhagavā,

The Fortunate One said this,

idaṁ vatvā Sugato athāparaṁ etad-avoca Satthā:

and after saying this, the Happy One, the Teacher, said something more:

“Araññe rukkhamūle vā, suññāgāre va bhikkhavo,

“In the wilds, at the root of a tree, or in an empty place, monks,

anussaretha Sambuddhaṁ, bhayaṁ tumhāka’ no siyā. [1]

you must recollect the Sambuddha, and there will be no fear for you.

No ce Buddhaṁ sareyyātha, lokajeṭṭhaṁ narāsabhaṁ,

If you can’t remember the Buddha, the world’s elder, the man-bull,

atha Dhammaṁ sareyyātha, niyyānikaṁ sudesitaṁ. [2]

No ce Dhammaṁ sareyyātha, niyyānikaṁ sudesitaṁ,

If you can’t remember the Dhamma, which leads out, which is well preached,

atha Saṅghaṁ sareyyātha, puññakkhettaṁ anuttaraṁ. [3]

then you must remember the Saṅgha, which is an unsurpassed field of merit.

Evaṁ Buddhaṁ sarantānaṁ, Dhammaṁ Saṅghañ-ca bhikkhavo,

Thus for those who remember the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, monks,

bhayaṁ vā chambhitattaṁ vā, lomahaṁso na hessatī” ti. [4]

The Reflections


Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso cīvaraṁ paṭisevāmi,

With proper discernment I make use of the robe,

yāvad-eva sītassa paṭighātāya, uṇhassa paṭighātāya,

only to ward off the cold, to ward off the heat,

ḍaṁsamakasavātātapasiriṁsapasamphassānaṁ paṭighātāya,

to ward off contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the heat (of the sun), and creeping things,

yāvad-eva hirikopīnapaṭicchādanatthaṁ. [1]

only as a cover for the shameful parts.

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso piṇḍapātaṁ paṭisevāmi,

With proper discernment I make use of almsfood,

neva davāya, na madāya, na maṇḍanāya, na vibhūsanāya,

not for sport, or for showing off, not for ornament, or for adornment,

yāvad-eva imassa kāyassa ṭhitiyā yāpanāya,

but only to maintain this body, and to carry on,

vihiṁsūparatiyā brahmacariyānuggahāya,

to inhibit annoyance, and to assist in the spiritual life,

iti purāṇañ-ca vedanaṁ paṭihaṅkhāmi,

and so I will get rid of any old feeling,

navañ-ca vedanaṁ na uppādessāmi,

and not produce any new feeling,

yātrā ca me bhavissati, anavajjatā ca phāsuvihāro cā ti. [2]

and there will be support for me, being blameless, and living comfortably.

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso senāsanaṁ paṭisevāmi,

With proper discernment I make use of a dwelling,

yāvad-eva sītassa paṭighātāya, uṇhassa paṭighātāya,

only to ward off the cold, to ward off the heat,

ḍaṁsamakasavātātapasiriṁsapasamphassānaṁ paṭighātāya,

to ward off contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the heat (of the sun), and serpents,

yāvad-eva utuparissayavinodanaṁ paṭisallānārāmatthaṁ. [3]

only to dispel the trouble of the (varying) seasons, and so as to delight in seclusion.

Paṭisaṅkhā yoniso gilānapaccayabhesajjaparikkhāraṁ paṭisevāmi,

With proper discernment I make use of the requisite of medicine for support when sick,

yāvad-eva uppannānaṁ veyyābādhikānaṁ vedanānaṁ paṭighātāya

only to ward off oppressive feelings that have arisen

abyāpajjhaparamatāyā ti. [4]

and at least be free from oppression.

Saminā kataṁ puññam mayaṁ dātabbaṁ,

The merit made by my lord should be shared with us,

(Sādhu! Anumoditabbaṁ,)

(Surely! You should share in it,)

Sādhu! Sādhu! Anumodāmi,

Surely! Surely! I share in it,

Okāsa dvarattayena kataṁ sabbaṁ aparādaṁ khamatha me bhante,

(Khamāmi, khamitabbaṁ!)

(I forgive you, you should forgive me!)

Okāsa khamāmi bhante!

With consent, I forgive you, Venerable Sir!
