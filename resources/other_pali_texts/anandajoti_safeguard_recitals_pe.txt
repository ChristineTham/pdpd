Karaṇīyam-atthakusalena, yan-taṁ santaṁ padaṁ abhisamecca:

What should be done by one skilled in goodness, who has comprehended the state of peace:



sakko ujū ca sūjū ca, suvaco cassa mudu anatimānī, [1]

° he ought to be able, straight, and upright, easy to speak to, meek, without conceit,



santussako ca subharo ca, appakicco ca sallahukavutti,

satisfied (with little), easy to support, free from duties, and light in living,



santindriyo ca nipako ca, appagabbho kulesu ananugiddho, [2]

with faculties at peace, prudent, not forward, and greedless among the families,



na ca khuddaṁ samācare kiñci yena viññū pare upavadeyyuṁ.

he should not do the slightest thing whereby others who are wise might find fault (with him).



“Sukhino vā khemino hontu, sabbe sattā bhavantu sukhitattā! [3]

“(May all beings) be happy and secure, may all beings in their hearts be happy!



Ye keci pāṇabhūtatthi tasā vā thāvarā vā anavasesā,

Whatsoever breathing beings there are trembling, firm, or any other (beings),



dīghā vā ye mahantā vā, majjhimā rassakāṇukathūlā, [4]

No one should cheat another, nor should he despise anyone wherever he is,



byārosanā paṭighasaññā nāññam-aññassa dukkham-iccheyya. [6]

° he should not long for suffering for another because of anger or resentment.



Mātā yathā niyaṁ puttaṁ āyusā ekaputtam-anurakkhe,

° In the same way as a mother would protect her child, her only child, with her life,



evam-pi sabbabhūtesu mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ. [7]

so too towards all beings one should develop the measureless thought (of friendliness).



Mettañ-ca sabbalokasmiṁ mānasaṁ bhāvaye aparimāṇaṁ,

° Towards the entire world he should develop the measureless thought of friendliness,



uddhaṁ adho ca tiriyañ-ca, asambādhaṁ averaṁ asapattaṁ. [8]

Tiṭṭhaṁ caraṁ nisinno vā, sayāno vā yāvatassa vigatamiddho,

Standing, walking, sitting, lying, for as long as he is without torpor,



etaṁ satiṁ adhiṭṭheyya, brahmam-etaṁ vihāraṁ idha-m-āhu. [9]

Diṭṭhiñ-ca anupagamma, sīlavā dassanena sampanno,

Without going near a (wrong) view, virtuous, and endowed with (true) insight,



kāmesu vineyya gedhaṁ, na hi jātu gabbhaseyyaṁ punar-etī ti. [10]

“The Fortunate One’s Saṅgha of disciples are good in their practice,

yad-idaṁ cattāri purisayugāni aṭṭha purisapuggalā,

that is to say, the four pairs of persons, the eight individual persons,



esa Bhagavato sāvakasaṅgho,

this is the Fortunate One’s Saṅgha of disciples,



āhuneyyo, pāhuneyyo, dakkhiṇeyyo, añjalikaranīyo,

they are worthy of offerings, of hospitality, of gifts, and of reverential

salutation,



anuttaraṁ puññakkhettaṁ lokassā” ti.

they are an unsurpassed field of merit for the world.”



Saṅghaṁ hi vo bhikkhave anussarataṁ

For, monks, to those who recollect the Saṅgha



yaṁ bhavissati bhayaṁ vā chambhitattaṁ vā lomahaṁso vā so pahīyissati.

whatever fear there may be, or terror, or horror, will be given up.



Taṁ kissa hetu?

What is the reason for that?



Tathāgato bhikkhave Arahaṁ Sammāsambuddho,

The Realised One, monks, the Worthy One, the Perfect Sambuddha,



vītarāgo, vītadoso, vītamoho, abhīru acchambhi{33} anutrāsi apalāyī” ti.

is free from passion, is free from hatred, is free from delusion, not being fearful, not terrified, not scared, he did not run away.”



Idam-avoca Bhagavā, idaṁ vatvā Sugato athāparaṁ etad-avoca Satthā:

The Fortunate One said this, and after saying this, the Happy One, the Teacher, said something more:



“Araññe rukkhamūle vā, suññāgāre va bhikkhavo,

“In the wilds, at the root of a tree, or in an empty place, monks,



anussaretha Sambuddhaṁ, bhayaṁ tumhāka’ no siyā. [1]

you must recollect the Sambuddha, and there will be no fear for you.



No ce Buddhaṁ sareyyātha, lokajeṭṭhaṁ narāsabhaṁ,

if you can’t remember the Buddha, the world’s elder, the man-bull,



atha Dhammaṁ sareyyātha, niyyānikaṁ sudesitaṁ. [2]

then you must remember the Dhamma, which leads out, which is well preached.



No ce Dhammaṁ sareyyātha, niyyānikaṁ sudesitaṁ,

If you can’t remember the Dhamma, which leads out, which is well preached,



atha Saṅghaṁ sareyyātha, puññakkhettaṁ anuttaraṁ. [3]

then you must remember the Saṅgha, which is an unsurpassed field of merit.



Evaṁ Buddhaṁ sarantānaṁ, Dhammaṁ Saṅghañ-ca bhikkhavo,

Thus for those who remember the Buddha, the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha, monks,



bhayaṁ vā chambhitattaṁ vā, lomahaṁso na hessatī” ti.{34} [4]

(there will be no) fear, or terror, there will be no horror.”

dukkho, anariyo, anatthasaṁhito.

which is painful, ignoble, and not connected with the goal.



Ete te bhikkhave ubho ante anupagamma, majjhimā paṭipadā

Not having approached either of these two extremes, monks, the middle practice



Tathāgatena abhisambuddhā, cakkhukaraṇī, ñāṇakaraṇī,

was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge,



upasamāya abhiññāya Sambodhāya Nibbānāya saṁvattati.

and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna.



Katamā ca sā bhikkhave majjhimā paṭipadā,

Now what is this middle practice, monks,



Tathāgatena abhisambuddhā, cakkhukaraṇī, ñāṇakaraṇī,

that was awakened to by the Realised One, which produces vision, produces knowledge,



upasamāya abhiññāya Sambodhāya Nibbānāya saṁvattati?

and which leads to peace, deep knowledge, Complete Awakening, and Nibbāna?

The Four Noble Truths



Idaṁ kho pana bhikkhave dukkhaṁ ariyasaccaṁ: [1]

Now this, monks, is the noble truth of suffering:



jāti pi dukkhā

birth is suffering



jarā pi dukkhā

also old age is suffering



vyādhi pi dukkho

also sickness is suffering



maraṇam-pi dukkhaṁ

also death is suffering



appiyehi sampayogo dukkho

being joined to what is not dear is suffering



piyehi vippayogo dukkho

being separated from what is dear is suffering



yam-picchaṁ na labhati tam-pi dukkhaṁ

also not to obtain what one longs for is suffering



saṅkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā.

in brief, the five constituent groups (of mind and body) that provide fuel for attachment are suffering.



Idaṁ kho pana bhikkhave dukkhasamudayaṁ{69} ariyasaccaṁ: [2]

Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the arising of suffering:



yā yaṁ taṇhā ponobhavikā,

it is that craving which leads to continuation in existence,



nandirāgasahagatā, tatratatrābhinandinī, seyyathīdaṁ:

which is connected with enjoyment and passion, greatly enjoying this and that, as follows:



kāmataṇhā

craving for sense pleasures



bhavataṇhā

craving for continuation



vibhavataṇhā.

craving for discontinuation.



Idaṁ kho pana bhikkhave dukkhanirodhaṁ{70} ariyasaccaṁ: [3]

Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering:



yo tassā yeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho -

it is the complete fading away and cessation without remainder of that craving -



cāgo, paṭinissaggo, mutti, anālayo.

liberation, letting go, release, and non-adherence.



Idaṁ kho pana bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṁ: [4]

Now this, monks, is the noble truth of the practice leading to the end of suffering:



Ayam-eva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathīdaṁ:

It is this noble path with eight factors, as follows:



sammādiṭṭhi [1]

right view



sammāsaṅkappo [2]

right speech



sammākammanto [4]

right action



sammā-ājīvo [5]

right livelihood



sammāvāyāmo [6]

right endeavour



sammāsati [7]

right mindfulness



sammāsamādhi. [8]

right concentration.

Declaring the Awakening



Yāva kīvañ-ca me bhikkhave imesu catusu ariya-saccesu

For as long as to me, monks, in regard to these four noble truths



- evaṁ tiparivaṭṭaṁ dvādasākāraṁ -

- turned like this, in three ways, twelvefold -



yathābhūtaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ na suvisuddhaṁ ahosi,

knowledge and insight as it really is was not quite clear,



neva tāvāhaṁ bhikkhave sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake,

for that long, monks, I did not declare to the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahma,



sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya,

to this generation, with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men,



anuttaraṁ sammāsambodhiṁ abhisambuddho paccaññāsiṁ.

that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening.



Yato ca kho me bhikkhave imesu catusu ariyasaccesu

But when to me, monks, in regard to these four noble truths



- evaṁ tiparivaṭṭaṁ dvādasākāraṁ -

- turned like this, in three ways, twelvefold -



yathābhūtaṁ ñāṇadassanaṁ suvisuddhaṁ ahosi,

knowledge and insight as it really is was quite clear



athāhaṁ bhikkhave sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake

then, monks, I did declare to the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahma,



sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya,

to this generation, with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men,



anuttaraṁ sammāsambodhiṁ abhisambuddho paccaññāsiṁ.

that I was fully awakened with unsurpassed complete awakening.



Ñāṇañ-ca pana me dassanaṁ udapādi:

To me knowledge and seeing arose:



“Akuppā me cetovimutti

“Sure is my freedom of mind



ayam-antimā jāti

this is my last birth



natthi dāni punabbhavo” ti.

now there is no continuation of existence.”



The First Attainment



Idam-avoca Bhagavā,

The Fortunate One said this,



attamanā pañcavaggiyā bhikkhū Bhagavato bhāsitaṁ abhinandun-ti.

and the group-of-five monks were uplifted and greatly rejoiced in what was said by the Fortunate One.



Imasmiñ-ca pana veyyākaraṇasmiṁ bhaññamāne,

Moreover, as this sermon was being given,



āyasmato Koṇḍaññassa virajaṁ, vītamalaṁ,

to venerable Koṇḍañña the dust-free, stainless,



Dhammacakkhuṁ udapādi:

Vision-of-the-Dhamma arose:



Yaṁ kiñci samudayadhammaṁ, sabban-taṁ{71} nirodhadhamman-ti.

Whatever has the nature of arising, all that has the nature of ceasing.

might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm,



evam-evaṁ Suddhāvāsesu devesu antarahitā

in the same way disappeared from among the gods of the Pure Abodes

“In this place the monks are concentrated, they have straightened out their minds by themselves,

“Evaṁ bhante” ti kho te bhikkhū Bhagavato paccassosuṁ,

“Yes, reverend Sir,” those monks replied to the Fortunate One,



Bhagavā etad-avoca:

and the Fortunate One said this:



“Silokam-anukassāmi yattha Bhummā tad-assitā:

“I will repeat a famous verse (a Siloka) wherever the gods of the Earth live:

upapanno jutīmanto, bhismākāyo yasassi so. [62]

a bright one, who stands out, whose awesome body is resplendent.



Dasettha Issarā āgu, paccekavasavattino,

The ten Issarā (brahmās) came, who individually wield power,



tesañ-ca majjhato āga Hārito parivārito. [63]

and in the midst of them came Hārita with his entourage.



Māra and his Army



Te ca sabbe abhikkante, sa-Inde deve sabrahmake,

Now when they had all drawn near, Inda with the gods and the brahmās,



Mārasenā abhikkāmi:{112} passa Kaṇhassa mandiyaṁ! [64]

Māra’s army also drew near: behold the foolishness of the Dark One!



“Etha gaṇhatha bandhatha, rāgena bandham-atthu ve,{113}

“Come now, seize them, and bind them (he said), let them be bound by passion,



samantā parivāretha, mā vo muñcittha koci naṁ!” [65]

surround them on all sides, do not let anyone of them go free!”



Iti tattha mahāseno kaṇhasenaṁ apesayī,{114}

Thus in that place the great army leader sent forth his dark army,



pāṇinā thalam-āhacca, saraṁ katvāna bheravaṁ, [66]

after striking the ground with his hand, and making a fearful noise,



yathā pāvussako megho, thanayanto savijjuko -

like a storm cloud shedding rain, thundering, with flashes of lightning -



tadā so paccudāvatti, saṅkuddho asayaṁvasī. [67]

but then he retreated, angry, and unable to control himself.



Tañ-ca sabbaṁ abhiññāya vavakkhitvāna Cakkhumā,

Knowing all that (was happening) the Visionary desired to speak,



tato āmantayī Satthā sāvake sāsane rate: [68]

therefore the Teacher addressed those disciples who delight in the teaching:



“Mārasenā abhikkantā, te vijānātha bhikkhavo!”

“Māra’s army has drawn near (to us), you should know who they are, monks!”



Te ca ātappam-akaruṁ, sutvā Buddhassa sāsanaṁ.

Then (those monks) became ardent, after hearing the Buddha’s teaching.



Vītarāgehapakkāmuṁ,{115} nesaṁ lomam-pi iñjayuṁ!{116} [69]

They withdrew from the passionless (monks), not one of their hairs was

shaken!



Spoken by Māra



“Sabbe vijitasaṅgāmā, bhayātītā{117} yasassino,

“They are all victorious in battle, beyond fear, and resplendent,



modanti saha bhūtehi, sāvakā te jane sutā” ti. [70]

those disciples, famous among men, along with (all) beings, are glad.”





24. Ālavakasuttaṁ

The Discourse concerniṅg Ālavaka




Evaṁ me sutaṁ:

Thus I have heard:



ekaṁ samayaṁ Bhagavā Ālaviyaṁ viharati

at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Ālavī



Ālavakassa yakkhassa bhavane.

in the domicile of the yakkha Ālavaka.



Atha kho Ālavako yakkho yena Bhagavā tenupasaṅkami,

Then the yakkha Ālavaka approached the Fortunate One,



upasaṅkamitvā Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

and after approaching he said this to the Fortunate One:



“Nikkhama samaṇā!” ti,

“Get out, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā nikkhami.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he got out.



“Pavisa samaṇā!” ti,

“Go in, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā pāvisi.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he went in.



Dutiyam-pi kho Ālavako yakkho Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

For a second time the yakkha Ālavaka said this to the Fortunate One:



“Nikkhama samaṇā!” ti,

“Get out, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā nikkhami.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he got out.



“Pavisa samaṇā!” ti,

“Go in, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā pāvisi.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he went in.



Tatiyam-pi kho Ālavako yakkho Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

For a third time the yakkha Ālavaka said this to the Fortunate One:



“Nikkhama samaṇā!” ti,

“Get out, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā nikkhami.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he got out.



“Pavisa samaṇā!” ti,

“Go in, ascetic!”



“Sādhāvuso” ti Bhagavā pāvisi.

“Yes, friend”, said the Fortunate One, and he went in.



Catuttham-pi kho Ālavako yakkho Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

For a fourth time the yakkha Ālavaka said this to the Fortunate One:



“Nikkhama samaṇā!” ti,

“Get out, ascetic!”



“Na khvāhaṁ āvuso{118} nikkhamissāmi,

“I certainly will not get out, friend,



yaṁ te karaṇīyaṁ taṁ karohī” ti.

so please do whatever it is you must do.”



“Pañhaṁ taṁ samaṇa pucchissāmi, sace me na vyākarissasi,

“I will ask you a question, ascetic, and if you do not answer me,



cittaṁ vā te khipissāmi, hadayaṁ vā te phālessāmi,

I will overthrow your mind, or split your heart,



pādesu vā gahetvā pāragaṅgāya khipissāmī” ti.

or seize you by the feet and throw you across the river.”



“Na khvāhaṁ{119} taṁ āvuso passāmi,

“I certainly do not see, friend,



sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake,

in the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahma,



sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya,

in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men,



yo me cittaṁ vā khipeyya, hadayaṁ vā phāleyya,

anyone who could overthrow my mind, or split my heart,



pādesu vā gahetvā pāragaṅgāya khipeyya.

or seize me by the feet and throw me across the river.



Api ca tvaṁ āvuso puccha yad-ākaṅkhasī” ti.

Still, you may ask what you want, friend.”



Atha kho Ālavako yakkho Bhagavantaṁ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi:

Then the yakkha Ālavaka recited a verse to the Fortunate One:



“Kiṁ sūdha vittaṁ purisassa seṭṭhaṁ? Kiṁ su suciṇṇo sukham-āvahāti?

“What is the greatest wealth for a person here? What, when accomplished, brings about happiness?



Kiṁ su have sādutaraṁ{120} rasānaṁ? Kathaṁ jīviṁ jīvitam-āhu seṭṭhan?” ti {121} [1]

What, for sure, is the sweetest of tastes? Living what life do they say is the greatest?”



“Saddhīdha vittaṁ purisassa seṭṭhaṁ. Dhammo suciṇṇo sukham-āvahāti.

“Confidence is a person’s greatest wealth here. The Dhamma, when accomplished, brings about happiness.



Saccaṁ have sādutaraṁ rasānaṁ. Paññājīviṁ jīvitam-āhu seṭṭhan”-ti. [2]

Truth, for sure, is the sweetest of tastes. Living a wise life they say is the greatest.”



“Kathaṁ su taratī oghaṁ? Kathaṁ su tarati{122} aṇṇavaṁ?

“How does one cross over the flood? How does one cross over the sea?



Kathaṁ su dukkhaṁ acceti? Kathaṁ su parisujjhati?” [3]

How does one overcome suffering? How does one become purified?”



“Saddhāya taratī{123} oghaṁ. Appamādena aṇṇavaṁ.

“Through confidence one crosses the flood. Through heedfulness (one crosses) the sea.



Viriyena dukkhaṁ acceti. Paññāya parisujjhati.” [4]

Through energy one overcomes suffering. Through wisdom one is purified.”



“Kathaṁ su labhate paññaṁ? Kathaṁ su vindate dhanaṁ?

“How is it one gains true wisdom? How is it one finds true wealth?



Kathaṁ su kittiṁ pappoti? Kathaṁ mittāni ganthati?

How does one acquire good repute? How does one bind friends (to

oneself)?



Asmā lokā paraṁ lokaṁ kathaṁ pecca na socati?” [5]

How, after passing from this world to the next world, does one not grieve?”



“Saddahāno Arahataṁ Dhammaṁ Nibbānapattiyā,

“Confident in the Worthy Ones’ Dhamma (taught) for attaining Nibbāna,



sussūsā labhate paññaṁ, appamatto vicakkhaṇo. [6]

one gains wisdom through wanting to hear it, heedfulness, and application.



Patirūpakārī dhuravā, uṭṭhātā vindate dhanaṁ.

Doing what is suitable, bearing up, aroused, one finds true wealth.



Saccena kittiṁ pappoti. Dadaṁ mittāni ganthati. [7]

Through truth one acquires good repute. (Through) giving one binds friends (to oneself).



Yassete caturo dhammā saddhassa gharamesino:

That confident householder who has these four things:



saccaṁ, Dhammo, dhitī,{124} cāgo, sa ve pecca na socati,

truth, Dhamma, courage, liberality, after passing away he does not grieve,



asmā lokā paraṁ lokaṁ evaṁ pecca na socati.{125} [8]

thus, after passing from this world to the next world, one does not grieve.



Iṅgha aññe pi pucchassu, puthū{126} samaṇabrāhmaṇe,

Come now, ask others also, the many ascetics and brahmins,



yadi saccā damā cāgā khantyā bhiyyo na vijjati.”{127} [9]

if there is something more than truth, self-control, liberality, and patience.”



“Kathan nu dāni puccheyyaṁ, puthū samaṇabrāhmaṇe?

“Why should I ask (others) now, the many ascetics and brahmins?



Sohaṁ ajja pajānāmi yo attho{128} samparāyiko. [10]

Today I have come to know what is the next life’s true welfare.



Atthāya vata me Buddho vāsāy’ Ālavim-āgamī.{129}

Indeed for my welfare did the Buddha come and spend time in Ālavī.



Sohaṁ ajja pajānāmi yattha dinnaṁ mahapphalaṁ. [11]

When today I have come to know where that which is given bears great fruit.



So ahaṁ vicarissāmi gāmā gāmaṁ purā puraṁ,

I will roam about from village to village, city to city,



namassamāno Sambuddhaṁ Dhammassa ca sudhammatan”-ti. [12]

revering the Sambuddha and the good qualities of the Dhamma.”



Evaṁ vatvā{130} Ālavako yakkho Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

After saying this, the yakkha Ālavaka said this to the Fortunate One:



“Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama! Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama!

“Excellent, reverend Gotama! Excellent, reverend Gotama!



Seyyathā pi bho Gotama nikkujjitaṁ vā ukkujjeyya,

Just as, reverend Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned,



paṭicchannaṁ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṁ ācikkheyya,

or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,



andhakāre vā telapajjotaṁ dhāreyya cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhintī ti,

or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms,



evam-evaṁ bhotā Gotamena anekapariyāyena Dhammo pakāsito.

just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way.



Esāhaṁ bhavantaṁ Gotamaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,

I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge,



Dhammañ-ca bhikkhusaṅghañ-ca.

and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.



Upāsakaṁ maṁ bhavaṁ Gotamo dhāretu

Please bear it in mind, reverend Gotama, that I am a lay disciple



ajjatagge pāṇupetaṁ saraṇaṁ gatan”-ti.

who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life.”





25. Kasībhāradvājasuttaṁ

The Discourse concerning Kasībhāradvāja




Evaṁ me sutaṁ:

Thus I have heard:



ekaṁ samayaṁ Bhagavā Magadhesu viharati

at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling amongst the Magadhans



Dakkhiṇāgirismiṁ Ekanālāyaṁ brāhmaṇagāme.

on the Southern Hill near the brahmin village Ekanālā.



Tena kho pana samayena Kasībhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa

Then at that time the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja



pañcamattāni naṅgalasatāni payuttāni honti vappakāle.

had about five hundred ploughs yoked up during the sowing season.



Atha kho Bhagavā pubbanhasamayaṁ nivāsetvā, pattacīvaram-ādāya,

Then the Fortunate One, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up his bowl and robe,



yena Kasībhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa kammanto tenupasaṅkami.{131}

approached the place where the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja was working.



Tena kho pana samayena Kasībhāradvājassa brāhmaṇassa parivesanā vattati.

Then at that time the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja’s food distribution was proceeding.



Atha kho Bhagavā yena parivesanā tenupasaṅkami,

Then the Fortunate One approached the food distribution,



upasaṅkamitvā ekam-antaṁ aṭṭhāsi.

and after approaching he stood on one side.



Addasā kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo Bhagavantaṁ piṇḍāya ṭhitaṁ,

The brahmin Kasībhāradvāja saw the Fortunate One standing for alms,



disvāna Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

and after seeing him he said this to the Fortunate One:



“Ahaṁ kho samaṇa kasāmi ca vapāmi ca,

“Ascetic, I plough and I sow,



kasitvā ca vapitvā ca bhuñjāmi.

and after ploughing and sowing I eat.



Tvam-pi samaṇa kasassu ca vapassu ca,

You also, ascetic, should plough and sow,



kasitvā ca vapitvā ca bhuñjassū” ti.

and after ploughing and sowing you can eat.”



“Aham-pi kho brāhmaṇa kasāmi ca vapāmi ca,

“Brahmin, I also plough and sow,



kasitvā ca vapitvā ca bhuñjāmī” ti.

and after ploughing and sowing I eat.”



“Na kho pana mayaṁ passāma bhoto Gotamassa

“But we do not see the reverend Gotama’s



yugaṁ vā naṅgalaṁ vā phālaṁ vā pācanaṁ vā balivadde vā,

yoke or plough or ploughshare or goad or oxen,



atha ca pana bhavaṁ Gotamo evam-āha:

but still the reverend Gotama said this:



‘Aham-pi kho brāhmaṇa kasāmi ca vapāmi ca,

‘Brahmin, I also plough and sow,



kasitvā ca vapitvā ca bhuñjāmī’ ” ti.

and after ploughing and sowing I eat.’ ”



Atha kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo Bhagavantaṁ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi:

Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja recited a verse to the Fortunate One:



“Kassako paṭijānāsi na ca passāma te kasiṁ.

“You claim that you are a ploughman, but we do not see your ploughing.



Kasiṁ no pucchito brūhi yathā jānemu te kasiṁ.”{132} [1]

Please tell us about ploughing when asked so that we may know your ploughing.”



“Saddhā bījaṁ, tapo vuṭṭhi, paññā me yuganaṅgalaṁ,

“Confidence the seed, austerity the rain, wisdom is my yoke and plough,



hiri īsā, mano yottaṁ, sati me phālapācanaṁ. [2]

conscience the pole, mind is the strap, mindfulness is my ploughshare and goad.



Kāyagutto, vacīgutto, āhāre udare yato,

With body guarded, speech guarded, and stomach restrained regarding food,



saccaṁ karomi niddānaṁ, soraccaṁ me pamocanaṁ. [3]

I make truth the mower, temperance the setting free (of the yoke).



Viriyaṁ me dhuradhorayhaṁ, yogakkhemādhivāhanaṁ -

Energy my beast of burden, the vehicle yoked to security -



gacchati anivattantaṁ yattha gantvā na socati. [4]

without turning back it goes to that place where, having gone, one does not grieve.



Evam-esā kasī kaṭṭhā sā hoti amatapphalā,

Thus this ploughing has been ploughed that produces the fruit of the deathless,



etaṁ kasiṁ kasitvāna sabbadukkhā pamuccatī” ti. [5]

and after ploughing this ploughing one is set free from all suffering.”



Atha kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo

Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja



mahatiyā kaṁsapātiyā pāyāsaṁ vaḍḍhetvā Bhagavato upanāmesi:

having arranged milk-rice in a large bronze bowl presented it to the Fortunate One, saying:



“Bhuñjatu bhavaṁ Gotamo pāyāsaṁ,

“Eat this milk-rice, reverend Gotama,



kassako bhavaṁ, yaṁ hi bhavaṁ Gotamo{133}

the reverend one is a ploughman, for the reverend Gotama



amataphalaṁ kasiṁ kasatī” ti.

ploughs the ploughing which has the deathless as fruit.”



“Gāthābhigītaṁ me abhojaneyyaṁ,{134} sampassataṁ brāhmaṇa nesa Dhammo,

“I will not eat what is gained through chanting verses, that is not the Dhamma, brahmin, of those who see,



gāthābhigītaṁ panudanti Buddhā, Dhamme satī brāhmaṇa vutti-r-esā. [6]

Buddhas reject what is gained through chanting verses, while Dhamma lasts, brahmin, this is their way of life.



Aññena ca kevalinaṁ{135} mahesiṁ, khīṇāsavaṁ kukkuccavūpasantaṁ,

Another great sage, who is fully adept, pollutant-free, at peace regarding worry (about wrong-doing),



annena pānena upaṭṭhahassu, khettaṁ hi taṁ puññapekhassa hotī” ti. [7]

attend to with food and drink, for that is the field for those who look for merit.”



“Atha kassa cāhaṁ bho Gotama imaṁ pāyāsaṁ dammī?” ti

“Then to whom, reverend Gotama, should I give this milk-rice?”



“Na khvāhaṁ taṁ{136} brāhmaṇa passāmi, sadevake loke samārake sabrahmake,

“I certainly do not see, brahmin, in the world with its gods, Māra, and Brahma,



sassamaṇabrāhmaṇiyā pajāya sadevamanussāya,

in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, princes and men,



yassa so pāyāso bhutto sammā pariṇāmaṁ gaccheyya,

anyone who, having eaten this milk-rice, could properly digest it,



aññatra Tathāgatassa vā Tathāgatasāvakassa vā.

except a Realised One or a Realised One’s disciple.



Tena hi tvaṁ brāhmaṇa taṁ pāyāsaṁ appaharite vā chaḍḍehi,

Therefore, brahmin, cast away that milk-rice where there is but little grass,



appāṇake vā udake opilāpehī” ti.

or drop it into water which has no breathing creatures.”



Atha kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo taṁ pāyāsaṁ appāṇake udake opilāpesi.

Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja dropped that milk-rice into water which had no breathing creatures.



Atha kho so pāyāso udake pakkhitto

Then that milk-rice being thrown into water



cicciṭāyati ciṭiciṭāyati sandhūpāyati sampadhūpāyati,

did hiss and sizzle and steam and smoke,



seyyathā pi nāma phālo divasasantatto udake pakkhitto

just as a ploughshare heated for a day when thrown into water



cicciṭāyati ciṭiciṭāyati sandhūpāyati sampadhūpāyati,

hisses and sizzles and steams and smokes,



evam-eva so pāyāso udake pakkhitto

so that milk-rice being thrown into water



cicciṭāyati ciṭiciṭāyati sandhūpāyati sampadhūpāyati.

did hiss and sizzle and steam and smoke.



Atha kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo, saṁviggo, lomahaṭṭhajāto,

Then the brahmin Kasībhāradvāja, anxious, and horrified,



yena Bhagavā tenupasaṅkami,

approached the Fortunate One,



upasaṅkamitvā Bhagavato pādesu sirasā nipatitvā,

and after approaching he fell down placing his head at the Fortunate One’s feet,



Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

and said this to the Fortunate One:



“Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama! Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama!

“Excellent, reverend Gotama! Excellent, reverend Gotama!



Seyyathā pi bho Gotama nikkujjitaṁ vā ukkujjeyya,

Just as, reverend Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned,



paṭicchannaṁ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṁ ācikkheyya,

or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,



andhakāre vā telapajjotaṁ dhāreyya cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhintī ti,

or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms,



evam-evaṁ bhotā Gotamena anekapariyāyena Dhammo pakāsito.

just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way.



Esāhaṁ bhavantaṁ Gotamaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,

I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge,



Dhammañ-ca bhikkhusaṅghañ-ca.

and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.



Labheyyāhaṁ bhoto Gotamassa santike pabbajjaṁ,

May I receive the going forth in the presence of reverend Gotama,



labheyyaṁ upasampadan” ti.

may I receive the full ordination.”



Alattha kho Kasībhāradvājo brāhmaṇo

The brahmin Kasībhāradvāja received



Bhagavato santike pabbajjaṁ, alattha upasampadaṁ.

the going forth in the presence of the Fortunate One, received full ordination.



Acirūpasampanno kho panāyasmā Bhāradvājo,

Then not long after ordination, venerable Bhāradvāja,



eko, vūpakaṭṭho, appamatto, ātāpī, pahitatto viharanto,

while dwelling solitary, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute,



na cirasseva yassatthāya kulaputtā

after no long time (attained) that good for which young gentlemen



sammad-eva agārasmā anagāriyaṁ pabbajanti,

rightly go forth from the house to the houseless life,



tad-anuttaraṁ brahmacariyapariyosānaṁ,

that unsurpassed conclusion to the spiritual life,



diṭṭheva dhamme sayaṁ abhiññā, sacchikatvā, upasampajja vihāsi.

and dwelt having known, experienced, and attained it himself in this very life.



Khīṇā jāti

Destroyed is (re)birth



vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ

accomplished is the spiritual life



kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ

done is what ought to be done



nāparaṁ itthattāyā ti abbhaññāsi.

there is no more of this mundane state - this he knew.



Aññataro ca kho panāyasmā Bhāradvājo Arahataṁ ahosī ti.

And venerable Bhāradvāja became another of the Worthy Ones.





26. Parābhavasuttaṁ

The Discourse on Ruin




Evaṁ me sutaṁ:

Thus I have heard:



ekaṁ samayaṁ Bhagavā Sāvatthiyaṁ viharati

at one time the Fortunate One was dwelling near Sāvatthī



Jetavane Anāthapiṇḍikassa ārāme.

at Anāthapiṇḍika’s grounds in Jeta’s Wood.



Atha kho aññatarā devatā abhikkantāya rattiyā,

Then a certain god, towards the end of the night,



abhikkantavaṇṇā kevalakappaṁ Jetavanaṁ obhāsetvā,

whose surpassing beauty lit up the whole of Jeta’s Wood,



yena Bhagavā tenupasaṅkami,

approached the Fortunate One,



upasaṅkamitvā Bhagavantaṁ abhivādetvā ekam-antaṁ aṭṭhāsi.

and after approaching and worshipping the Fortunate One, he stood on one side.



Ekam-antaṁ ṭhitā kho sā devatā Bhagavantaṁ gāthāya ajjhabhāsi:

While standing on one side that god recited a verse to the Fortunate One:



“Parābhavantaṁ purisaṁ mayaṁ pucchāma Gotamaṁ -

“We ask (reverend) Gotama regarding the man going to ruin -



Bhagavantaṁ puṭṭham-āgamma, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [1]

we have come to ask the Fortunate One, what is the cause of ruination?”



“Suvijāno bhavaṁ hoti, suvijāno parābhavo,

“The thriving man is easy to know, the ruining man is easy to know,



Dhammakāmo bhavaṁ hoti, Dhammadessī parābhavo.” [2]

the thriving man loves the Dhamma, the ruining man hates the Dhamma.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, paṭhamo so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the first ruin (of man).



Dutiyaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [3]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the second cause of ruin?”



“Asantassa piyā honti, sante na kurute piyaṁ,

“The bad are dear to him, he does not endear the good,



asataṁ Dhammaṁ roceti, taṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ.” [4]

he is pleased with the Dhamma of the bad, that is a cause of ruination.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, dutiyo so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the second ruin (of man).



Tatiyaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [5]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the third cause of ruin?”



“Niddāsīlī sabhāsīlī, anuṭṭhātā ca yo naro,

“That man who is fond of sleep, fond of society, unaroused,



alaso kodhapaññāṇo, taṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ.”[6]

lazy, and marked by anger, that is a cause of ruination.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, tatiyo so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the third ruin (of man).



Catutthaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [7]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the fourth cause of ruin?”



“Yo mātaraṁ vā pitaraṁ vā jiṇṇakaṁ gatayobbanaṁ,

“He who, when his mother or father has grown old, with their youth gone,



pahusanto{137} na bharati, taṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ.” [8]

though having much, does not support them, that is a cause of ruination.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, catuttho so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the fourth ruin (of man).



Pañcamaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [9]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the fifth cause of ruin?”



“Yo brāhmaṇaṁ vā samaṇaṁ vā, aññaṁ vā pi vaṇibbakaṁ

° “He who deceives a brahmin, or an ascetic, or another mendicant



musāvādena vañceti, taṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ.” [10]

with words that are false, that is a cause of ruination.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, pañcamo so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the fifth ruin (of man).



Chaṭṭhamaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [11]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the sixth cause of ruin?”



“Pahūtavitto puriso, sahirañño sabhojano,

“That man who has abundant wealth, who has gold, who has food,



eko bhuñjati sādūni, taṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ.” [12]

but who eats his sweetmeats alone, that is a cause of ruination.”



“Iti hetaṁ vijānāma, chaṭṭhamo so parābhavo.

“Indeed it is so, this we know, this is the sixth ruin (of man).



Sattamaṁ Bhagavā brūhi, kiṁ parābhavato mukhaṁ?” [13]

Please tell us, Fortunate One, what is the seventh cause of ruin?”



Jātitthaddho dhanatthaddho, gottatthaddho ca yo naro,

“That man who is proud of his birth, his wealth, and his ancestry,

“Right there, shaveling! Right there, little ascetic! Right there, outcaste! Halt!”



Evaṁ vutte Bhagavā Aggikabhāradvājaṁ brāhmaṇaṁ etad-avoca:

After this was said, the Fortunate One said this to the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja:



“Jānāsi pana tvaṁ brāhmaṇa vasalaṁ vā vasalakaraṇe vā dhamme?” ti

“But do you know, brahmin, what an outcaste is, or what things make one an outcaste?”



“Na khvāhaṁ bho Gotama jānāmi, vasalaṁ vā vasalakaraṇe vā dhamme.

“I certainly do not know, reverend Gotama, what an outcaste is, or what things make one an outcaste.



Sādhu me bhavaṁ Gotamo tathā Dhammaṁ desetu

It would be good for me if the reverend Gotama would preach the Dhamma



yathāhaṁ jāneyyaṁ vasalaṁ vā vasalakaraṇe vā dhamme” ti.

so that I may know what an outcaste is, and what things make one an outcaste.”



“Tena hi brāhmaṇa suṇāhi, sādhukaṁ manasikarohi bhāsissāmī” ti.

“Then listen, brahmin, apply your mind well, and I will speak.”



“Evaṁ bho,” ti kho Aggikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo

“Yes, reverend,” the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja

is a thief in the world with its brahmās, he is the worst of the outcastes.



Ete kho vasalā vuttā, mayā vo ye pakāsitā. [20]

These, indeed, are said to be outcastes, those whom I have explained to you.



Na jaccā vasalo hoti, na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo,

One is not an outcaste by birth, by birth one is not a brahmin,



kammanā vasalo hoti kammanā hoti brāhmaṇo. [21]

by deeds one becomes an outcaste, one becomes a brahmin by deeds.



Tad-aminā pi jānātha,{149} yathā medaṁ nidassanaṁ:

You can know it also by this, as I (give you) this example:



caṇḍālaputto Sopāko Mātaṅgo iti vissuto. [22]

Sopaka, an untouchable’s son, was renowned as Mātaṅga.



So yasaṁ paramaṁ patto, Mātaṅgoyaṁ sudullabhaṁ,

This Mātaṅga attained the highest repute, which was very hard to obtain,



āgañchuṁ tassupaṭṭhānaṁ khattiyā brāhmaṇā bahū. [23]

and many nobles and brahmins came to attend on him.



So devayānam-āruyha, virajaṁ so mahāpathaṁ,

He ascended the way going to the gods, that dust-free great path,



kāmarāgaṁ virājetvā, brahmalokūpago ahu.

and having put away sensual desire, he went to the brahma worlds.



Na naṁ jāti nivāresi brahmalokūpapattiyā. [24]

Birth did not prevent him from being reborn in the brahma worlds.



Ajjhāyakakule jātā, brāhmaṇā mantabandhuno,

Brahmins, though born in a family of scholars, and acquainted with the lore,



te ca pāpesu kammesu abhiṇham-upadissare. [25]

are continuously to be seen (doing) deeds that are bad.



Diṭṭheva dhamme gārayhā samparāye ca duggatiṁ.{150}

Reproachable in this life, in the next life they have an unhappy destiny.



Na te jāti nivāreti duggaccā garahāya vā. [26]

Birth does not prevent reproach or an unhappy destiny.



Na jaccā vasalo hoti, na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo,

One is not an outcaste by birth, by birth one is not a brahmin,



kammanā vasalo hoti kammanā hoti brāhmaṇo” ti. [27]

by deeds one becomes an outcaste, one becomes a brahmin by deeds.”



Evaṁ vutte Aggikabhāradvājo brāhmaṇo Bhagavantaṁ etad-avoca:

After this was said, the brahmin Aggikabhāradvāja said this to the Fortunate One:



“Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama! Abhikkantaṁ bho Gotama!

“Excellent, reverend Gotama! Excellent, reverend Gotama!



Seyyathā pi bho Gotama nikkujjitaṁ vā ukkujjeyya,

Just as, reverend Gotama, one might set upright what has been overturned,



paṭicchannaṁ vā vivareyya, mūḷhassa vā maggaṁ ācikkheyya,

or open up what has been closed, or show a path to one who is lost,



andhakāre vā telapajjotaṁ dhāreyya cakkhumanto rūpāni dakkhintī ti,

or bear an oil lamp in the darkness so that one who has eyes can see forms,



evam-evaṁ bhotā Gotamena anekapariyāyena Dhammo pakāsito.{151}

just so has the Dhamma been made clear by reverend Gotama in more than one way.



Esāhaṁ bhavantaṁ{152} Gotamaṁ saraṇaṁ gacchāmi,

I go to the reverend Gotama for refuge,



Dhammañ-ca bhikkhusaṅghañ-ca.

and to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.



Upāsakaṁ maṁ bhavaṁ Gotamo dhāretu

Please bear it in mind, reverend Gotama, that I am a lay disciple



ajjatagge{153} pāṇupetaṁ saraṇaṁ gatan”-ti.

who has gone for refuge from today forward for as long as I have the breath of life.”

Tattha santi uḷārā yakkhā nivāsino

And there are high ranking yakkhas settled there



ye imasmiṁ Bhagavato pāvacane appasannā.

who are not pleased with the word of the Fortunate One,



Tesaṁ pasādāya uggaṇhātu bhante Bhagavā “Āṭānāṭiyaṁ” rakkhaṁ,

To please then, reverend Sir, may the Fortunate One learn this “Āṭānāṭiya” protection,



bhikkhūnaṁ, bhikkhuṇīnaṁ, upāsakānaṁ, upāsikānaṁ,

Adhivāsesi Bhagavā tuṇhībhāvena.

The Fortunate One by keeping silent gave consent.
