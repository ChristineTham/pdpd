# Contributing to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

There are many ways to contribute to the project, but the two main areas that need attention are __code__ and __Pāḷi__.

[Get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) if you are able to help.

## Pāḷi 

If you are skilled in Pāḷi, either through monastic or academic training, please get in touch about what task needs to be tackled next.  

The following help is required from coders

### Code Review
Most of the code has been written by non-professional coders. Please get in touch to take one portion of the code, understand it's purpose and provide suggestions for improvement. 

### Python development
Python is the main language used throughout the project. If you are a Python developer, please get in touch to find out what needs to be done next.

### GO development
When Python is too _slow_, use _GO_. If you are a GO developer, please get in touch about which modules need a speed-up.  

### Flutter development
A dedicated Flutter App is a long-term goal of the project, integrating all the current features of DPD into a multi-platform application. If you are a Flutter developer and can help in any way, from conceptualization to code reviews, please get in touch.
