# Contributing to Digital Pāḷi Dictionary

There are many ways to contribute to the project, but the two main areas that need attention are __code__ and __Pāḷi__.

[Get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com) if you are able to help.

## Pāḷi 

If you are skilled in Pāḷi, either through monastic or academic training, please get in touch about what task needs to be tackled next.  

## Code

The following help is required from coders

### 1. Code Review
Most of the code has been written by non-professional coders. Please get in touch to take one portion of the code, understand it's purpose and provide suggestions for improvement. 

### 2. Python development
Python is the main language used throughout the project. If you are a Python developer, please get in touch to find out what needs to be done next.

### 3. GO development
When Python is too _slow_, use _GO_. If you are a GO developer, please get in touch about which modules need a speed-up.  

### 4. Flutter development
A dedicated Flutter App is a long-term goal of the project. If you are a Flutter developer please get in touch.
